## Overview
This is a beginner-level **bioinformatics mini project** developed in Python to analyze DNA sequences. It includes key features such as:

- GC content calculation  
- Codon frequency analysis  
- Reverse complement generation  
- Motif identification  
- Graphical GC content visualization

This project is ideal for **BTech Biotechnology students** aiming to combine biology with programming.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- `collections` module  
- `matplotlib` for plotting  
- Basic string and list operations

---

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the provided Python script in any Python 3 environment.
3. Modify the `sequence` variable to test your own DNA sequences.

---

## Features
- **GC Content Calculation** – shows % of Guanine and Cytosine in sequence.
- **Codon Frequency** – identifies the most frequent codon.
- **Reverse Complement** – generates the 5' to 3' strand.
- **Motif Search** – finds repeated biological patterns like "TATA".
- **GC Plot** – line graph to visualize GC distribution across sequence.
