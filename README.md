## Overview

This is a **bioinformatics mini project** designed to introduce basic DNA sequence analysis using **Python**. It is especially suited for biotechnology students who want to enter the **IT sector** or pursue higher studies in **bioinformatics**, especially in countries like **Germany**.

---

## Project Objectives

The project performs the following:
- Calculate **GC content** of a DNA sequence
- Identify the **most frequent codon**
- Generate the **reverse complement** of the sequence
- Detect **biological motifs** like `TATA`
- Visualize **GC content graphically**

---

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python 3.x**
- `collections` module
- `matplotlib.pyplot` for visualization

No external bioinformatics tools are required, making it beginner-friendly.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the Python script file (`dna_analyzer.py`) in your Python IDE.
3. Replace the `sequence` variable with your own DNA sequence.
4. Run the script to see output in the console and a plot window.
